			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img src="images/me.jpg" alt="A picture of me, taken at the Nara Observation Deck." style="width:100%; margin-bottom: 1em">
			<p>My name is Christopher Tse. My family is of Chinese origin but I was born and raised in Canada for most of my life. Thanks to that, my native language is English but I'm also able to speak Cantonese with family members at home. I also grew up going to french immersion schools in Canada from kindergarten through high school, so I have learned French as well, though it's rather rusty from lack of practice.</p>

			<p>I'm a 21 year old student currently staying in Japan for an exchange program through my home university. My hobbies include reading, web design, programming, and listening to music. I also am very fond of all things anime, manga, and other otaku-related things, which is one of the main reasons I wanted to come study in Japan. In my spare time I also like to play video games and practice playing the piano and guitar.</p>

			<h1>My Studies</h1>
			
			<img src="images/oulogo-sm.png" alt="The University of Oklahoma" class="pull-left" style="max-width: 100px; margin-right: 1em">
			<p>After finishing high school in Canada, I moved to the United States for my college education as I eventually want to hold a dual passport for Canada and the United States. I started at the University of Central Oklahoma, a smaller school where I initially had wanted to take an Engineering Physics degree and hopefully become a physicist in the future. However, once I had been exposed to programming courses along with some inspiration through fiction material I had read, I decided that I would switch to a Computer Engineering degree. Recently, I have realized that I don't enjoy electrical engineering and electronics very much, and have decided to narrow my studies to pure Computer Science.</p>

			<h1>My Impressions on Japan</h1>
		
			<img src="images/uec.png" alt="University of Electro-Communications" class="pull-right" style="max-width:220px">
			<p>My first impressions of Japan upon arrival was that it was a very beautiful country. Even at the airport, everyone was so helpful and kind, it was rather unexpected. It was a refreshing experience for me, coming from America. Although I had many imagined views of what Japan would be like, I kept an open mind as I started my first few weeks of life in Chofu and at the University of Electro-Communications.</p>
			<p>I really enjoyed Japanese food back in Canada and the US, and when I came to Japan, I could enjoy the authenticity of the Japanese cuisine that I couldn't get very much of. Shopping is also very convenient in Japan compared to my home countries thanks to convenience stores here carrying many products that one might need everyday, and supermarkets carrying everything from food to household appliances.</p>
			<p>One of my motivations for coming to Japan was my love for anime, manga, and other related hobbies. These hobbies are not very common in my home countries, and it was very hard to find books, games, and figures that I liked. However, here in Japan, we have Akihabara, one of the most famous cities for otaku-related products and hobbies.</p>
			<p>The University of Electro-Communications was also quite a change for me. At my home university, there is no focus on research unless you are a graduate student. Here, it was refreshing to see all the students finding fields of research they are interested in, or already having fields they are studying in. It shows the students' passions for their studies and their fields.</p>
